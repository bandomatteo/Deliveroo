Building on our DEAR framework, we can further enhance the systemâ€™s robustness, performance, and scalability:

\paragraph{Hybrid approach}
    Use the PDDL solver only for a small part of the code, using more plain javascript and enabling to have more control over the agent.
    In this way the agent can be more complicated without changing much of the domain representation.

\paragraph{Embed a local PDDL solver} 
    Replace the remote API calls with an embedded planner running in-process.  
    This removes network-induced delays and world-drift inconsistencies, guarantees data coherence, and enables tighter integration between the planner and the world model.

We think that  adopting this change will dramatically reduce latency, eradicate API-related synchronization errors, and lay the foundation for a more resilient, high-throughput multi-agent planning platform.
